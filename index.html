        <h1>Blog</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to my humble beginnings</h2>
        <p>And so a new life begins; I created this alter ego so I can speak more freely without worry
            of what friends, family, and most importantly, work, thinks. I aim to maintain a clear
            seperation of my real life from this account, but, if you do know me, I might share things
            with you which could lead to this blog. Welcome.
        </p>
        <p>First and foremost, I have grown and realized there is more to life than code, even though I
            still consider code a fundamental part of my life. This blog is about me speaking, on whatever
            topics I wish (but, spoiler alert, it will be mostly technical). The first order of business
            is to create some rules about how I will approach writing software. Why? I am well-known for
            starting things which I don't finish, and it would be nice to avoid that trap (again). So,
            some simple rules for my projects on this account:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Keep the scope small; no project should take longer than a weekend to complete. If I think
                I need to write something larger than that, I should break it apart.
            </li>
            <li>Once a project is finished, I should never have to touch it again. The greatest cost in software
                development is maintainence. I should do my best to write software once, the right away, and
                never reopen a project after I have marked it as complete.
            </li>
            <li>When possible, reuse rather than redo. This goes for both reusing of my projects, and reusing
                well-known projects where it is reasonable. This rule is a bit more fungible though, since half
                the fun of coding is writing something, and if I spend all my time looking at existing solutions,
                I'll never get too write.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>With those rules in mind, my first task is already very obvious. I need a tool to generate my
            Github pages (aka, this blog) for me. Ideally, most of the content I write should be content and not
            markup, so naturally, we will roll with markdown as the authoring language. At this point, I don't want
            to bother with a hosting solution, so we will just generate HTML files which get uploaded to Github.
            So, step 1, write a Markdown parser, and step 2, write something to use that markdown parser along with a template
            file to generate meaningful HTML.
        </p>
        <p>And already, we break rule 3. There are a TON of Markdown parsers out there, but most of them seem to go
            from Markdown to some other language (HTML), which tend to make them not super extensible. I'm also aware
            of some pretty well-known tools (Jekll) which are often used for this purpose, but I hate Ruby.
        </p>
        <p>Over-codes Markdown parser (oc-markdown) is a Markdown parser written in Rust which produces a AST that
            can be in other software to render markdown. Status: not started.
